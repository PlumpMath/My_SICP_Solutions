Bitdiddle wrote a simple program to test whether his interpreter follows a normal-order evaluation or a  applicative-order evaluation
if the normal-order evaluation was followed, this would have given me 0 everytime.
and if applicative-order evaluation was followed this would've resulted in infinite recursion call and stack overflow.
