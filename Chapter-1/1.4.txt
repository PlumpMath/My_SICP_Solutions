Exercise 1.4: Observe that our model of evaluation allows for combinations whose operators are compound expressions. Use this observation to describe the behavior of the following procedure:

(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
  ((if (> b 0) + -) a b))

#Answer
 The function name says it all "a plus absolute b"
if b> 0 will return a+b 
else returns a-b 
(a simple way to illutsate procedure passing " + " "-" passed as arguments)
